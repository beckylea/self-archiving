# A Guide To Self-Archiving Your Academic Papers

This website provides a guide for academics looking to self-archive their academic papers.

*Self-archiving*, also known as *green open access*, is a way that academics can make their published research freely available online to anyone. Many big publishers allow self-archiving in some form, though often subject to certain restrictions that this guide will cover.

You might wonder why you need to self-archive if your research paper has been published. Well, especially if you're in the humanities, your papers are probably locked behind a journal paywall. This means that scholars and students at institutions without wealthy libraries, independent scholars, journalists, and members of the public are going to be blocked from reading your paper. That's bad for them and for you. They don't get to learn from your research and you lose out on capturing their interest, which can mean missing out on citations or favorable media coverage. Plus, if you received funding for your research, they may require your papers to be freely available to everyone.
