# A Guide To Self-Archiving Your Academic Papers

This website provides a guide for academics looking to self-archive their academic papers.

*Self-archiving*, also known as *green open access*, is a way to make your published research freely available online to anyone. You can do this by uploading your accepted manuscript (*not* the final version typeset by the journal) to your personal website or an online repository. Many big publishers allow self-archiving in some form, though often subject to certain restrictions that this guide will cover.

You might wonder why you need to self-archive if your research paper has been published. Well, especially if you're in the humanities, your papers are probably locked behind a journal paywall. This means that scholars and students at institutions without wealthy libraries, independent scholars, journalists, and members of the public are going to be blocked from reading your paper unless they pay a hefty fee to the journal. That's bad for them and for you. They probably won't be willing to pay the $40 it costs to access just one paper and so won't get to learn from your research. And that means you lose out on capturing their interest, which can mean missing out on citations or favorable media coverage. Plus, if you received funding for your research, your funders may require your papers to be made freely available to everyone.

So how do you go about self-archiving your papers? The first step is to figure out what your publisher's self-archiving policy is.
